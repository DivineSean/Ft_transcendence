# INFO: These settings are commented out because the current environment lacks the necessary permissions to enable them. 
#       - `bootstrap.memory_lock: true` requires system-level privileges to lock JVM memory, which helps prevent swapping and improves stability. 
#         Enabling this in production ensures better performance, especially under heavy loads.
#       - `cluster.initial_master_nodes`: Used to bootstrap multi-node clusters. Since this is a single-node setup, it is unnecessary here. 
#         For production with multiple nodes, this ensures proper cluster formation.
#       - `discovery.type: single-node`: Explicitly indicates a single-node environment, which simplifies configuration. 
#         It is sufficient for development but not recommended for production where scalability and fault tolerance are needed.
